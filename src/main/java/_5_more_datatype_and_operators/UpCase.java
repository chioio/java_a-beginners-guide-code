 * The Bitwise Operators:
 *  The bitwise operators can be used on values of type 'long, int, short, char,
 * or byte'. Bitwise operations cannot be used on 'boolean, float, or double', or
 * class types. They are called the bitwise operators because they are used to
 * test, set, or shift the individual bits that make up a value. Bitwise operations
 * are important to a wide variety of systems-level programming tasks in which
 * status information(查询；审讯) from a device must be interrogated or constructed.
 *      Operator        Result
 *          &       |   Bitwise AND
 *          |       |   Bitwise OR
 *          ^       |   Bitwise exclusive(异) OR
 *          >>      |   Shift right
 *          >>>     |   Unsigned shift right
 *          <<      |   Shift left
 *          ~       |   One's complement(补码) (unary(一元的) NOT)
 *
 * The Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT Operators:
 *  The bitwise operators AND, OR, XOR, and NOT are '&, |, ^, and ~'. They perform
 * the same operations as their Boolean logical equivalents(相等物；等价物) described
 * in Chapter 2(_2_intro_datatype_and_operators). The difference is that the bitwise
 * operators work on a bit-by-bit basis. The following table shows the outcome of
 * each operation using 1's and 0's:
 *       p       q       p & q       p | q       p ^ q       ~p
 *       0   |   0   |     0     |     0     |     0     |   1
 *       1   |   0   |     0     |     1     |     1     |   0
 *       0   |   1   |     0     |     1     |     1     |   1
 *       1   |   1   |     1     |     1     |     0     |   0
